Widget Content
----

If you want to add content to your website you have two options to do this:
<p>via the <span style="color:darkorange">Frontend</span> and via the <span style="color:cornflowerblue">Backend</span>.</p>
<p>We recommend to use the Frontend, so you won't have to insert the route manually.</p>


###<span style="color:darkorange">Frontend</span>

If you are on the frontend you'll find a **plus-button** on the upper right corner of the particular container which leads you directly to the backend.

By following these steps you can create **new content** :

- choose a **template**
- choose a **widget style** if needed 
- insert the **content** depending on the widget
- define on which site the content should appear by setting the **route** (e.g. <code>"app/site/index"</code>)
- choose one of the following container: <code>top</code>;<code>main</code>;<code>bottom</code>
- choose a **rank** to set the position of the widget (e.g. <code>"000"</code> for the header. We recommend to use at least 3 digits in case you want to put something in between later)
- click **create**

###<span style="color:cornflowerblue">Backend</span>

If you are on the submenu "widget content" a list of all added widgets is provided.

Here you have to click the <span style="color:mediumseagreen">**new**</span> button up left (see image below) and follow the previously said steps.
