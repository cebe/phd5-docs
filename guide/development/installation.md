## New project

When starting a new project it is recommended to **download the [latest release](https://github.com/dmstr/phd5-ce/releases)**
and create a fresh repository from it.

    cd myapp
    git init    
    git add .
    git commit -m "inital commit"
  
> :bulb: It is recommended to create an initial commit from the unmodified template code, before making the first changes.
