When starting a new project it is recommended to download a [packaged release](https://github.com/phundament/app/releases)
and create a fresh repository from it.

    cd myapp
    git init

> :bulb: It is recommended to create an initial commit from the unmodified template code, before making the first changes, see [tutorials](../6-tutorials/git-repository.md) for details.
