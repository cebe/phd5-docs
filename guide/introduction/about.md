## Manifesto

**phd** is a holistic web-application template implementation, aiming on flexibility, modularization, performance and security on a minimal codebase.

It embraces a complete application life-cycle, from initial development over testing and CI to deployment.

Its toolset is infrastructure-agnostic and can be run on various platforms, such as Linux, OS X, Windows, AWS and other PaaS and cloud providers.

The standard modules are content-agnostic and include environment-based configuration, authentication and authorization, build-automation, testing, i18n, key/value-store, code-generation (Models/DAO, REST/API), prototyping and semantic-versioning.

The application is built upon Docker, PHP, Yii 2.0 Framework and composer packages. Whenever possible **phd** uses a stable version for images and libraries. It is designed to be able to use an immensely wide set of libraries.

Packages, plugins, extensions and libraries are hand-picked by core-developers, focussing on maintainability of the whole application stack, while it also follows the [12factor specifications](http://12factor.net).


Production ready and industrial grade delivery, with regular updates ensured through automated build processes. - **phd** is built, developed and maintained by dmstr.
